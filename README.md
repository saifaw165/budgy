## *Personal budgeting dashboard project*

Personal project used to consolidate all bank statements creating an ETL framework ending in a published Tableau dashboard. Looking for an interactive way to manage spending from different accounts.

2. [Visual output ](#visual-output)


### Pre-analysis questions 
Initial thoughts when conducting this is to both answer certain questions and confirm initial budgeting hypothesis that I had: 
<ol>
  <li>I am spending more than I am earning</li>
  <li>Biggest expenditure is my partner</li>
  <li>Where can I reduce costs?</li>
  <li>How consistent are my additional income streams?</li>
</ol>


An intiial flow was created below to map out the different stages of the ETL process

Tech stack used to create this are:
- Python
- SQL
- Tableau
